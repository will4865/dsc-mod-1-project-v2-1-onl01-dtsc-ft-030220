# Module 1 Project README- William Newton Online DS FT 030220

In this repo you will find the below deliverables and analysis for the Module 1 Project - Movie Analysis for the Full Time Online Data Science Curriculum

Data was pulled from the below sources:

- IMDB Crew and Title Data from 
    - https://datasets.imdbws.com/ (csv files exist on my local computer because size was too large to include in my github repo
- Box Office Gross Data from The-Numbers.com 
    - https://www.the-numbers.com/
    
This data was cleaned and combined into one master dataframe from which I derived all visualizations and findings

# Findings 

Through this data science exercise I was able to analyze the movie business as it stands today, and offer recommendations based on that same data.

The data was able to show that while box office gross had increased year over year since 2000, money spent by the various studios on these projects has remained surprisingly steady and had actually decreased from it's peak in 2013.

The inverse relationship between the amount of movies being made and the average production budgets of those same movies made it clear that Hollywood studios are making their priority be releasing fewer, mega-budgeted movies in theaters per year

# Recommendations

Release movies in genres that are proven to be successful and that audiences have an appetite for. Those tend to be live action and animated Action/Adventure movies. These films have accounted for 40% of the total box office from 2000-2018

Work with directors and writers that have a proven track record and whose's career is on the upswing. Avoid working with directors responsible for some of the most notorious flops in history.

Once you have hired the right director/writer combo to make your guranteed $2 billion dollar Action/Adventure hit, make sure you release that film during the months where those films are most succesful relative to the box office gross as a whole: early Summer and late Fall/Winter (the months where families are together and kids are out of school)

# Conclusion

Microsoft should do the following to ensure that their foray into the movie business goes well

- Make movies in the Live Action/Animated Adventure Genre
- Work with established and consistent writers and directors
- Release their movie in the early Summer/late fall to maximize profit
